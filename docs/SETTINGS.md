# Settings

Every setting the extension contributes, what it does, and its default. All live
under the `tn3270.` prefix in your user or workspace `settings.json`. Most take
effect immediately in open sessions; the exceptions are noted.

Open **3270 Terminal: Open Settings** from the command palette, or open the
editor settings UI and search for `tn3270`:

- **macOS** — **Cursor → Settings → Settings** (or **Code → Settings → Settings**
  in VS Code), or **⌘,**. For `settings.json`: **⌘⇧P** → **Preferences: Open User
  Settings (JSON)**.
- **Windows / Linux** — **File → Preferences → Settings**, or **Ctrl+,**. For
  `settings.json`: **Ctrl+Shift+P** → **Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)**.

## Moving from `tnzView.*`

These settings were called `tnzView.*` before the extension was renamed, and the
extension id changed with the name. The first activation after upgrading copies
every old value it recognises to the new key, and copies your script macros from
the old extension's storage folder into the new one. Nothing already set under
`tn3270.*` is overwritten. You are then asked once whether to delete the old
keys; declining leaves them in place, where the editor will flag them as unknown
settings but nothing will read them. `tnzView.tnzPath` is the only key that was
also renamed, to `tn3270.libraryPath`. No passwords are involved, because none
were ever stored.

## Connection and hosts

### `tn3270.hosts`

Array of saved host profiles, shown in the **Hosts** tree. Normally you edit these
through **Add Host** / **Edit Host** rather than by hand, but they are plain JSON.
Each profile is an object; the fields are listed under
[Host profile fields](#host-profile-fields) below.

- Type: `array`
- Default: `[]`

### `tn3270.pythonPath`

Python 3.10+ interpreter that has the `tnz` package installed. Empty uses the `py`
launcher or `python` on the `PATH`.

- Type: `string`
- Default: `""`
- Applies: next connect (the sidecar is spawned per session)

### `tn3270.libraryPath`

Optional path to a local [IBM/tnz](https://github.com/IBM/tnz) checkout, added to
`PYTHONPATH`. For developing against an unreleased tnz; leave empty to use the
installed package.

- Type: `string`
- Default: `""`
- Applies: next connect

## Appearance

### `tn3270.fontFamily`

Default font for the 3270 screen, as a CSS font list, e.g. `Cascadia Mono` or
`"IBM 3270", Consolas`. Must be monospaced: columns sit on a fixed pitch, so a
proportional font will not line up. The size is not set here; it grows to fill the
panel. A host profile with its own **Font** overrides this. Empty uses the
built-in stack of Lucida Console, Cascadia Mono, Consolas and Courier New.

- Type: `string`
- Default: `""`
- Applies: live, to every session that has not set its own font

### `tn3270.selection`

How selecting and copying works in a session.

- `block` (default) — marks a rectangle of rows and columns, like Vista TN3270 and
  PCOMM. Drag to mark, Shift+click to extend, Ctrl+A to mark the whole screen.
- `stream` — a linear run of characters like a text editor, which also allows
  dragging text out to another app and the webview's own right-click Copy.

Either way, Ctrl+C copies and Ctrl+V pastes, and non-display (password) fields
read as blanks so they can never be copied.

This setting governs the **mouse** only. Shift+arrows mark a rectangle from the
keyboard in either mode, anchored on the 3270 cursor, and Escape drops it. See
[KEYMAP.md](KEYMAP.md) for the `local:mark*` actions behind those chords.

- Type: `string` (`block` | `stream`)
- Default: `block`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.crosshair`

Draw a rule line through the cursor, as PCOMM and Vista do, to find it on a
crowded screen. The line follows the 3270 cursor, not the mouse, so it also shows
where typing will land.

- `off` (default), `row`, `column`, or `cross` for both

- Type: `string` (`off` | `row` | `column` | `cross`)
- Default: `off`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.cursor.style`

Shape of the 3270 cursor: a full-height `block` or a bottom `underline`. Insert
mode shows the other shape, so the two states are always distinguishable
whichever way round they are.

- Type: `string` (`block` | `underline`)
- Default: `block`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.cursor.blink`

Blink the cursor, the way a real terminal does.

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`
- Applies: live

## Hotspots and the alarm

### `tn3270.hotspots`

Make text on the screen clickable. `F3=Exit` sends PF3, and an `http://` or
`https://` address opens in your browser.

Only **protected** fields count. Applications write their function-key legends
into protected fields and everything you type goes into unprotected ones, so a
click in an entry field always just moves the cursor. A word is a hotspot if it
reads `PF3`, `F3`, `F3=Exit` or `3=Exit`, for keys 1 to 24; a bare number is
data, not a key. Ctrl+click is left to `tn3270.clickMacro`.

- `click` (default) — a single click follows the hotspot
- `doubleclick` — a double-click follows it; a single click still moves the
  cursor, and a double-click elsewhere still sends ENTER
- `off` — clicks only move the cursor

- Type: `string` (`click` | `doubleclick` | `off`)
- Default: `click`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.alarm`

Sound a short beep when the host sets the alarm bit in a write control character
— the 3270's own bell, which TSO, ISPF and CICS use to say something needs
attention. The tone is generated in the session panel, so it follows the system
output volume and needs no sound file.

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `true`
- Applies: live

## Capture and logging

Two palette commands write the screen to a file:

- **3270 Terminal: Capture Screen** — the screen as it stands, in one text file.
- **3270 Terminal: Start or Stop Session Log** — every screen from now until it
  is stopped, each with a timestamp header. The tab title gains `(log)` while it
  runs, and a screen is recorded once it has stood still for a moment, so typing
  a command leaves one entry rather than one per keystroke. Closing the tab stops
  the log and closes the file.

Non-display fields are blank in both, because the sidecar blanks them before the
screen ever reaches this side. A password cannot be captured or logged.

### `tn3270.capture.directory`

Where both commands write. A relative path is taken from the workspace folder,
`~` from your home directory. Empty uses the extension's own storage folder, and
the message that appears after each capture has an **Open** button.

- Type: `string`
- Default: `""`
- Applies: next capture

## Keyboard and macros

### `tn3270.keymap`

Overrides for 3270 key bindings. Each entry maps a chord such as `alt+1` to an
action:

- `aid:<name>` — `enter`, `clear`, `attn`, `pa1`–`pa3`, `pf1`–`pf24`
- `nav:<name>` — `tab`, `backtab`, `left`, `right`, `up`, `down`, `home`, `end`,
  `wordleft`, `wordright`, `backspace`, `delete`, `eraseeof`, `eraseinput`,
  `newline`
- `local:<name>` — `insert`, `reset`
- `macro:<name>` — a `tn3270.macros` entry

An empty value removes a default binding. Run **3270 Terminal: Show Keyboard Map** to
see the merged result. Full syntax is in [KEYMAP.md](KEYMAP.md).

The mouse wheel is bound the same way, under the chord names `wheelup`,
`wheeldown`, `wheelleft` and `wheelright`.

- Type: `object` (chord → action string)
- Default: `{}`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.wheel.horizontal`

Let a sideways tilt wheel send PF10 and PF11, the keys that shift left and right
in ISPF. Off by default: elsewhere those keys are whatever the application made
them, and a tilt wheel is easy to nudge by accident.

The vertical wheel always sends PF7 and PF8. Both pairs can be rebound in
`tn3270.keymap`, and binding `wheelleft` or `wheelright` there works whether or
not this setting is on, because overrides are merged over the defaults.

Wheel motion moves the cursor to the cell under the pointer before sending the
AID, and is ignored while the host holds the keyboard. See
[KEYMAP.md](KEYMAP.md#the-wheel).

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.macros`

Named macros, played from a `macro:<name>` keymap chord or **3270 Terminal: Run Macro**.
A value is one of:

- a **tape** string with `[action]` markers, e.g. `TSO[enter][wait]LISTC[enter]`
- an array of tape strings
- a **script**, `{ "script": "startlpar" }`, naming a Python file in the macros
  folder (**3270 Terminal: Open Macros Folder**)

Never put a password in this setting. Details and the script API are in
[MACROS.md](MACROS.md).

- Type: `object` (name → tape | tape[] | `{ "script": string }`)
- Default: `{}`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.clickMacro`

Name of a `tn3270.macros` entry to run on Ctrl+click (Cmd+click on macOS) in a
session. The click position is passed to the script as `click`. Empty means a
Ctrl+click only moves the cursor. Typical value: `startlpar`.

- Type: `string`
- Default: `""`
- Applies: live

### `tn3270.macroTrace`

Log every step a script macro takes to the **3270** output channel: what is typed,
which AID key is sent, where the cursor was, and what `on_screen`/`wait_for` found.
Passwords from `ask_password` are shown as asterisks. The channel opens itself when
a traced macro starts.

- Type: `boolean`
- Default: `false`
- Applies: next macro run

## File transfer

### `tn3270.transfer.syntax`

How IND$FILE options are introduced.

- `tso` (default) — bare keywords: `IND$FILE GET 'MY.DATA' ASCII CRLF`. TSO rejects
  a parenthesis with `IKJ56712I INVALID KEYWORD, (`.
- `cms` — options after a parenthesis: `IND$FILE GET FN FT FM ( ASCII CRLF`.

A host profile's **IND$FILE syntax** overrides this, which is what to use if you
reach both TSO and VM systems.

- Type: `string` (`tso` | `cms`)
- Default: `tso`

### `tn3270.transfer.idleTimeout`

Seconds to wait for IND$FILE to respond before giving up. The clock resets whenever
the transfer makes progress, so this only fires when the host has gone quiet —
usually because the command was typed somewhere that is not a ready prompt.

- Type: `number` (minimum `5`)
- Default: `60`

### `tn3270.transfer.options`

IND$FILE options offered as the default when starting a transfer, e.g.
`RECFM(V) LRECL(255)`. `ASCII` and `CRLF` are added automatically for text
transfers.

- Type: `string`
- Default: `""`

See [TRANSFER.md](TRANSFER.md) for host file-name formats and what the failure
messages mean.

## Host profile fields

These live inside each object in `tn3270.hosts`. The host settings tab writes them
for you; this is what it writes.

| Field | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `id` | string | Stable identifier, generated for new profiles |
| `label` | string | Name shown in the Hosts tree |
| `group` | string | Optional sidebar folder |
| `host` | string | DNS name or IP |
| `port` | number | TCP port. New profiles start on 23; TLS moves to 992 |
| `secure` | boolean | TLS. New profiles are plain telnet (`false`) |
| `verifyCert` | boolean | Verify the server certificate (TLS only) |
| `secLevel` | number | TLS level for older stacks; `1` is common. Omit for default |
| `luName` | string | LU name; requires `tn3270e`. A pinned LU allows only one session at a time |
| `tn3270e` | boolean | Negotiate TN3270E |
| `codePage` | string | EBCDIC code page, e.g. `037` |
| `psSize` | string | Screen size as `rowsxcols`, e.g. `24x80` or `30x133` |
| `extendedColor` | boolean | Advertise colour capability to the host |
| `blink` | boolean | Render the blink highlight instead of ignoring it |
| `colors` | object | Per-host palette (`background`, `black`, `blue`, `red`, `pink`, `green`, `turquoise`, `yellow`, `white`) |
| `fontFamily` | string | Per-host font; empty follows `tn3270.fontFamily` |
| `connectMacro` | string | Macro to run once the host draws its first screen after connecting; empty means none |
| `transferSyntax` | string | `tso`, `cms`, or empty to follow `tn3270.transfer.syntax` |
| `transferOptions` | string | Default IND$FILE options; empty follows `tn3270.transfer.options` |
| `transferIdleTimeout` | number | Seconds before a transfer is abandoned; `0` follows `tn3270.transfer.idleTimeout` |

The three transfer fields exist because IND$FILE syntax is a property of the host
rather than a preference: TSO rejects the parenthesis that CMS requires. A shop
with both kinds of system cannot be served by one workspace setting, so each
profile can pin its own and the settings act as the fallback.

`connectMacro` is the logon macro. It runs once per connect, and again on each
reconnect.

Timing is the whole difficulty with it. Connecting means the socket is up, which
happens well before the host has written anything, and the sidecar draws the
empty buffer straight away. Typing into that goes nowhere, and the logon panel
then arrives on top of it. So the macro waits for a screen that is unlocked, has
something on it, and has stopped changing for about half a second — the last
condition because VTAM front ends and session managers often paint two or three
panels in quick succession. There is no need to begin the macro with `[wait]`,
though one does no harm.

If no such screen arrives within thirty seconds the macro is not run at all, and
a warning says so rather than letting it type into whatever eventually appears.
The **3270** output channel records which screen it did start on, by its topmost
line, which is the quickest way to tell a macro that ran too early from one with
a bug in it.

Passwords are never stored in a profile. Log on in the 3270 screen, or use a script
macro that prompts with `ask_password`.

## Example

A working extract from a user `settings.json`. Hosts, fonts, macros, and keymap
overrides sit alongside each other; anything not listed here uses the defaults
above, so transfers here use TSO syntax. Three of the
profiles are shown so the shape is obvious: a dark BMC session with its own font,
a light Compuware session that inherits the global font, and a TLS host on a
non-standard port.

Do not put a password in a tape. The `mypassword` entry below is a placeholder;
the original used `[password:Password]` (or `ask_password` in a script) instead.

The rest of that user's hosts (DB2A, CW09, CW13, SYSP, ESAJ, VTHB) follow the same
shape as DB2B or CW01: same `codePage` and `tn3270e`, with `psSize`, `group`,
`blink`, and `colors` varying per LPAR.
