# Development history

This is a record of the Cursor chats that produced this extension (20 August – 9 September 2026), not a transcript dump. Tool calls, screenshots and log attachments are omitted; the decisions and the bugs that drove them are not.

It uses [IBM tnz](https://github.com/IBM/tnz) at runtime. Until 0.10.0 that was a `pip install` the user had to do; since then tnz and ebcdic are bundled.

The extension was called TNZ 3270 throughout the period this records, and its settings `tnzView.*`. Both were renamed in 0.9.0 when it moved to BMC: the names below are left as they were said at the time rather than rewritten.

## Why this exists

The starting point was a clone of IBM/tnz and the question whether it could become a VS Code or Cursor extension. tnz already speaks TN3270, including extended colour, file transfer and a character-cell API. What it does not provide is an editor UI.

Two fronts were considered: zti's curses terminal (easy, wrong for an editor) and a native 3270 webview driven by tnz's `Tnz` object (harder, what was wanted). The native view won. Hosts were to live in the activity bar; sessions as editor tabs with a fixed 3270 grid, not a VT terminal.

A separate repository was recommended so the extension would not sit inside the IBM/tnz checkout. It was built in this workspace, then moved to `spufidoo/tnz-view`.

Architecture that stuck from the first build:

- TypeScript extension for the tree, settings, commands and webview.
- A Python sidecar wrapping `tnz.Tnz`, talking JSON-lines over stdin/stdout. One process, one worker thread per session.
- Secrets stay out of settings; passwords are typed on the 3270 screen.

## 20–21 August — scaffold

Untagged; the first tag came on 24 August.

First working extension: host list, connect, webview screen, PF keys, ATTN, basic colour from field attributes. Packaged and installed in Cursor and VS Code.

## 24 August — first real session

Tags: `v0.1.0` `v0.1.1` `v0.1.2` `v0.1.4` `v0.1.5`

### Sidecar would not start

tnz tried to write `tnz.log` into the editor install directory (`C:\Program Files\cursor`), which is not writable. The sidecar now logs under `TNZ_VIEW_LOG_DIR` (the extension's global storage) or disables tnz file logging. The process is spawned with a writable cwd. A log channel was added so errors are copyable.

### Canvas vs text

The first screen was a `<canvas>`. Text could not be selected. It was rewritten as a DOM grid (`div` rows, `span` runs) so copy and paste work. The webview CSP forbids inline `style` attributes; colours are set from script via CSSOM.

`Ctrl+C` copies when there is a selection and sends ATTN when there is not.

### Hidden fields and colour

The logon password was visible. tnz does read the non-display bit; the sidecar was not applying field attributes across the buffer. `_effective_planes` propagates field attributes and extended colour/highlight, and `_mask_hidden` blanks non-display fields before they reach the webview.

The first paint was green on black. Field-attribute colour (protected / intensified) was implemented with a PCOMM-like palette, then compared against screenshots of a real emulator. Extended colour mode followed: advertise colour in the 3270 query reply (`capable_color`) so the host sends extended colour orders; the status line shows `BASE COLOR` or `EXT COLOR`. APL / box-drawing glyphs needed `cp310` loaded in the sidecar.

Windows pipes defaulted to cp1252, so those glyphs crashed the sidecar with `UnicodeEncodeError`. stdin/stdout/stderr are reconfigured to UTF-8, and `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` is set on spawn. Screen-update errors are caught so one bad paint cannot kill the session thread.

### Host editor

Sequential input boxes for host fields were replaced by a settings tab: all fields, extended colour, blink, and a live palette. Saving a profile repaints open sessions for colour and blink; geometry and TLS still need a reconnect.

That day's colour and editor work was committed and pushed on request.

## 25 August — reconnect, keys, files, macros

Tags: `v0.1.6` `v0.1.8` `v0.1.9` `v0.2.0` `v0.3.0` `v0.3.1` `v0.3.2`

### Session lost on TSO reconnect

Reconnecting to an existing TSO session failed with `TnzTerminalError: Invalid address`. The host was writing past the end of the client buffer because the session geometry had been set by another emulator (PCOMM at `30x133`) and TN3270E does not renegotiate it. Columns must match exactly; rows may be higher.

The host editor's screen size became free text with a datalist of standard models. A Unicode multiplication sign (`30×133`) failed `_util.session_ps_size`; both the sidecar and the editor now accept `×`. Lost-session messages started explaining the address error instead of discarding the exception.

### Keymap

Keys were an `if/else` chain in the webview. They became a chord → action table (`src/keymap.ts`), overridable with `tnzView.keymap`. Missing keys were added as table entries: PA1–3, Clear, End, word left/right, Erase Input, New Line, Reset. Reset is local (leave insert, clear the status); it cannot unlock a host-held keyboard.

**TNZ 3270: Show Keyboard Map** lists the bindings in effect. Chord syntax, AID vs nav vs local, and reserved keys are in [docs/KEYMAP.md](docs/KEYMAP.md). DUP and Field Mark were left out: they insert EBCDIC controls rather than calling a tnz key function.

### IND$FILE

Download and upload commands wrap `tnz.get_file` / `put_file` on the session thread, because tnz drives its own wait loop. The session must be at a ready prompt; the command is typed at the cursor. An idle timeout stops the loop spinning forever when IND$FILE never starts. Host-initiated transfers stay disabled.

Text mode needs `ASCII` and `CRLF` as whole words so tnz does the translation itself (the host's tables mangle `|`). The first parameter builder wrapped options in `(`, which is CMS convention. TSO answered `IKJ56712I INVALID KEYWORD, (`. TSO now gets bare keywords; `tnzView.transfer.syntax` selects `tso` (default) or `cms`. Walkthrough: [docs/TRANSFER.md](docs/TRANSFER.md).

Title-bar transfer buttons were declared but easy to miss; the commands stay in the palette even with no session focused, and they say so rather than vanishing. `tnzView.sessionActive` was only set from `onDidChangeViewState`, which does not fire when a panel is created, so a new session counted as inactive until the user clicked away and back.

### Macros

Named sequences in `tnzView.macros`, played from a key (`macro:<name>`) or **Run Macro**. Syntax is text with `[action]` markers, e.g. `=3.4[enter][wait]MY.JCL[enter]`. `[wait]` blocks on the keyboard lock rather than a guessed delay. Macros run on the session thread so typing cannot interleave. Passwords should not go in settings (plain text, often synced). A separate `MACROS.md` was declined; KEYMAP.md covers them.

After Run Macro from the palette, the 3270 ignored keys until a click. The palette returns focus to the webview document, not to `#screen`. The webview now focuses that element whenever the window regains focus.

## 26 August — polish and TLS

Tags: `v0.3.3` `v0.3.4` `v0.3.5`

### Field attribute column

An underscored input field looked one column too wide on the left. Every buffer position inherited the nearest field's extended highlighting, including the attribute byte itself. That byte occupies a screen position but belongs to no field; a 3270 shows it as a plain blank. It now keeps default planes while still setting what following positions inherit.

### TLS mismatch

Connecting to `www.moshix.tech:2023` dropped immediately with SESSION LOST. The port speaks TLS (`DO TERMINAL-TYPE` after a TLS handshake; the certificate validates). Connect had been reporting `connection lost during connect` and dropping the exception.

Failures now keep the original exception (and wrapped SSL causes) and add a sentence for TLS vs plain, certificate verification, refused, reset, timeout, DNS, and oversized screens. A handshake that never completes times out with that explanation instead of claiming success.

## 27–28 August — macros that think

Tags: `v0.4.0` `v0.5.3` `v0.6.2`

### Prompts in a tape macro

A logon macro needs a userid and a password it does not store. `[prompt:Label]` and `[password:Label]` ask before the tape plays, so nothing sensitive reaches `settings.json`. The first attempt rejected them with "does not take a value": the marker parser split on `:` and then complained that the action had an argument, because prompts were being checked against the AID and nav tables.

New host profiles also changed to what a mainframe shop actually meets first: plain telnet on port 23, code page 037. Right Ctrl became Reset, which is where a real 3270 keyboard has it.

### Vista-style script macros

A tape cannot make a decision. `startlpar.mac` from Vista TN3270 was the benchmark: read the screen, branch on what is there, ask mid-flight. Tapes were kept and joined by **script** macros — Python files in a macros folder, referenced as `{ "script": "startlpar" }`, run in the sidecar with a small API (`type`, `enter`, `on_screen`, `word_at`, `ask`, `ask_password`, `warn`).

Two failures came from how the script was compiled. A pre-flight `compile()` of the raw source rejected the top-level `return` the API encourages, and wrapping the source by indenting it broke multi-line strings and threw line numbers out. Both went away by wrapping through the `ast` module instead, which preserves positions. Ctrl+click was wired to `tn3270.clickMacro`, passing the cell under the pointer so a macro can start from what was clicked.

### Fonts per host

The font had to be set in `settings.json`, which is the wrong place for something that belongs to one host. It moved into the host settings tab, with the workspace `fontFamily` kept as the default when a profile leaves the box empty, and a preview that warns when the named font is not installed.

### Waiting for a screen, not an unlock

The logon script warned "Can't find the password prompt anywhere" the instant the userid was sent. `wait_unlock` returns when the keyboard unlocks, which happens several times during a logon, so the script was reading an intermediate screen. `wait_for` waits for content rather than a state, and `tn3270.macroTrace` with `trace` and `trace_screen` makes it possible to see which screen a script actually saw. Passwords are redacted from the trace.

## 1 September — selection, resilience, a name

Tags: `v0.7.1` `v0.7.2` `v0.8.0` `v0.8.1` `v0.9.0`

### Block selection

Selecting text behaved like Notepad: a run of characters that wraps. A 3270 user wants a rectangle. `tn3270.selection` chooses `block` (default) or `stream`, with block drawing its own marked rectangle over the grid because native selection cannot do columns.

### Keys VS Code was stealing

PF5 sent PF5 to TSO *and* started debugging. A webview cannot stop the workbench acting on a key it has also bound. The fix is a no-op command, `tn3270.session.keyGuard`, bound to the conflicting chords with a `when` clause of `activeWebviewPanelId == tn3270.session`: the workbench binding resolves to nothing and the webview's own handler still runs.

### Surviving a reload, and a sidecar that dies

A code review found several ways to be left with a live-looking dead session: an exception escaping a command handler killed the session's worker thread for good; reconnecting through an existing panel never restarted a dead sidecar; a transfer whose sidecar exited hung forever; and `SESSION_SECLEVEL` was set globally at connect and never cleared, so one profile's TLS level leaked into the next.

Each was contained rather than papered over — the worker loop catches per command, sends go through a wrapper that reports a dead sidecar in the OIA, pending transfers are failed on exit, and the environment variable is scoped to the call with a lock. A `WebviewPanelSerializer` was added at the same time, so 3270 tabs survive a window reload and reconnect themselves.

### A name that is not a library's

Tab titles read `DB2B.REP.plain`; a tester wanted `DB2B`. Status moved to the OIA where it belongs. Then the product name itself: `mdavage.tnz-view` became `mdavage.vscode-3270` and every `tnzView.*` setting became `tn3270.*`, with a one-time migration that copies settings and the macros folder and offers to remove the old keys.

Because the same source ships to two audiences, display names live in a branding overlay applied at package time: `3270 Terminal` by default, `BMC AMI DevX 3270` for the BMC build, from one identifier and one codebase. BMC GHE became `origin` with the public GitHub repo as a mirror.

## 2 September — no prerequisites

Tags: `v0.10.0`

Testers had to `pip install tnz ebcdic` before anything worked, which is a poor first five minutes and impossible to explain to a customer. Both packages are now fetched at package time into `sidecar/vendor` and put on `sys.path` ahead of anything else, so the extension installs and runs. They are not committed; the NOTICE records what is bundled and under which licence.

## 3 September — marking without a mouse, and a Mac keyboard

0.11.0, packaged and installed for testing; not yet tagged.

### Shift+arrows

Copying still needed the mouse: `Ctrl+C` could copy a mark but nothing could make one from the keyboard. Five `local:mark*` actions were added to the keymap table, bound by default to Shift+arrows and Escape, so they are rebindable and appear in Show Keyboard Map. The first press anchors on the 3270 cursor and only the far corner moves afterwards. The cursor itself stays put and nothing is sent to the host, so copying never costs the typing position.

### The anchor cell that would not mark

The first byte always looked unselected. Cursor and mark both paint white through a `difference` blend, so a cell carrying both is differenced twice and comes back looking untouched — necessarily the anchor cell, and any cell a drag crossed. The cursor is now hidden while it sits inside the mark.

### A right-click menu that works

Cut, Copy and Paste in the webview's context menu did nothing. That menu is built from Electron editing roles, which act on a DOM selection and an editable target; block mode suppresses the first and a grid of `div`s is never the second. Overriding the `copy` event would not have helped either, since with no selection it is never dispatched. The view now draws its own menu — Copy, Paste, Mark all — copying the mark and pasting via the extension host, the only side that can read the clipboard. No Cut: a terminal cannot cut host data.

### Transfer settings that belong to the host

Whether IND$FILE wants a parenthesis is a fact about the host, not a preference, so one workspace setting cannot serve a shop with both TSO and VM. Syntax, default options and idle timeout became host profile fields, with the `tn3270.transfer.*` settings as the fallback.

### The font list, three times over

Asking users to type a font name exactly is unkind, so the box was made to suggest what is installed. A webview cannot enumerate fonts — it knows only what it has loaded, and the browser API for system fonts needs a permission VS Code will not grant — so names are gathered in the extension host and measured in the webview, which drops anything that does not resolve or is not fixed pitch. Deliberately over-guessing is safe because measuring is the arbiter.

It then failed three times, each for a different reason. The Windows font registry holds face names, not families: `Sauce Code Pro Light Nerd Font Complete Mono` is a face of a family called `SauceCodePro Nerd Font Mono`, and only the family resolves, so every Nerd Font was discarded. Switching to the installed font families fixed that, but `System.Drawing` inherits GDI's `LOGFONT` limit and cuts names at 31 characters — `FantasqueSansMono Nerd Font Mon` — so WPF's list is now queried as well and both spellings offered. Finally the suggestions themselves were unusable: a `datalist` popup with a couple of hundred entries is taller than the screen and will not scroll inside a webview. The view draws its own list, filtered as you type, each row in its own font.

Diagnosing that middle failure needed evidence rather than theory, so the webview reports what it kept, what would not resolve and what was proportional to the log. That stays in: which fonts a webview can see varies by platform, and there is otherwise no way to tell a filtered font from a missing one.

### A dropdown that came up white

In a dark theme the IND$FILE syntax dropdown opened white with unreadable grey text. The `<select>` was themed but its popup is drawn by the browser, which follows `color-scheme`, and nothing was passing on the theme. VS Code puts the theme kind on the webview `<body>`, so that is now handed straight to the browser — which also fixes the other dropdowns and the type-ahead popups.

### Insert on a Mac

From a parallel chat, and folded in here. Apple keyboards have no Insert key, so the `insert` default was unreachable for the Mac tester — who also had no obvious way to reach `settings.json` to rebind it. Three things followed: a **Toggle Insert Mode** command, an **Open Settings** command (linked from the keyboard map view, which now allows command URIs), and a macOS-only default of `ctrl+i`.

That default has a limitation worth recording. `platformDefaults()` reads `process.platform` in the extension host, which is where the keymap is built. Over Remote-SSH the extension host runs on the remote machine, so a Mac user connected to a Linux host reports `linux` and silently loses the `ctrl+i` binding, while a Windows user on a Mac remote would gain it. Not worth fixing while nobody is running that way — the workaround is a `tn3270.keymap` entry, which is per-user anyway — but it is the first thing to check if a Mac tester says insert mode stopped working after moving to a remote workspace.

## 4 September — a save that said nothing

Tags: `v0.11.1`

Resetting a host palette to the defaults changed nothing, and the profile in `settings.json` still held the old colours. The form was posting the save and the write was being refused: VS Code will not write user settings while `settings.json` is open with unsaved changes. The rejection landed in an async message handler with no `catch`, so a save that failed looked exactly like a save that worked and changed nothing. Failures now go through `reportError` and into the form's status line, which named the cause on the first retry.

A profile edited anywhere else — by hand in `settings.json`, or arriving through Settings Sync — also left an open session on its old palette. The configuration listener refreshed the host tree but only pushed keymap, font and selection changes to sessions. Host changes now reach the session as well, through the same `applyProfile` the Save button has always used.

## 9 September — the wheel

Tags: `v0.12.0`

A mouse with a vertical and a horizontal wheel had nothing to do in a 3270 tab. Panning would be meaningless anyway — `fit()` sizes the grid to the panel, so the whole screen is always visible, and there is no scrollback behind it. The motion is only useful as an AID, which is what Vista and PCOMM make of it: PF7 and PF8, the keys that page in ISPF, SDSF and File-AID.

They became ordinary chords — `wheelup`, `wheeldown`, `wheelleft` and `wheelright` — so they are rebindable, take modifiers, and appear in Show Keyboard Map with no special case anywhere. Horizontal stays off until `tn3270.wheel.horizontal` is set, because PF10 and PF11 shift left and right in ISPF but are whatever the application made them elsewhere, and a tilt wheel is easy to catch by accident. The setting adds or removes those two defaults rather than being tested at dispatch, so the map view never lists a binding that does nothing.

Three details decided how it feels. The cursor moves to the cell under the pointer before the AID goes out, so a split ISPF screen scrolls the half being pointed at instead of the half the cursor was left in. Motion accumulates to a threshold rather than firing per event: a notched wheel sends one large delta where a free-spinning wheel or a trackpad sends a stream of small ones, and `deltaMode` reports lines or pages as readily as pixels. And nothing is sent while the keyboard is locked, since AIDs queued during `X SYSTEM` would arrive together and overshoot by however far the wheel spun in the meantime.

## 9 September — the easy half of the gap list

Tags: `v0.12.0`

A feature-by-feature comparison against PCOMM and Vista TN3270 produced twenty-eight things they have and we do not. Printing is the largest hole and a project of its own; six of the rest were small enough to do in an afternoon, and every one of them is noticed daily.

**The bell.** tnz reads the alarm bit out of the write control character and writes `<--- ALARM --->` to its log, which is the end of it: nothing is exposed to a caller. Rather than fork the vendored copy, the session wraps `_process_wcc` on the instance — an attribute of that name shadows the bound method, and every one of tnz's four call sites goes through the wrapper first. The flag it sets is read and cleared by the next screen, so a burst of writes rings once. On the view side the tone is an oscillator: the webview's content security policy allows no media source, and Web Audio needs none.

**Hotspots.** Clicking `F3=Exit` sends PF3, and an `http://` address opens in a browser. The trap here is a false positive in something you were only trying to click into, so a hotspot must sit in a **protected** field: applications write their legends into protected fields and everything a user types goes into unprotected ones, which draws the line exactly where it needs to be. A bare number is data rather than a key, so `3` is ignored where `F3` and `3=Exit` are not. Ctrl+click still belongs to the click macro.

**The rule line and the cursor.** The crosshair follows the 3270 cursor rather than the pointer, which is what makes it worth having: it says where typing will land. It reuses the difference blend the cursor and the mark already use, so it reads on a light palette as well as a dark one. Cursor shape and blink became settings at the same time, with insert mode showing whichever shape is not the configured one — inverting the pair keeps the two states apart however it is set.

**The logon macro.** A profile can now name a macro to run on connect, which is what `startlpar` always wanted to be. Firing it on the status event was obviously wrong — connected means the socket is up — so the first version waited for the first screen instead. That was still too early, as testing found within the hour: the sidecar draws the empty buffer as soon as the transport exists, so the macro typed a userid into nothing and the logon panel then landed on top of it. Putting a `[wait]` at the front of the tape worked around it. The condition is now three things together: the keyboard is unlocked, the screen has something on it, and it has stopped changing for half a second, since VTAM front ends paint two or three panels in a row. After thirty seconds of no such screen it gives up and says so, rather than typing into whatever eventually appears, and the screen it does start on is logged by its topmost line.

**Capture and logging.** Two palette commands write screens to text files, one for the screen in front of you and one that keeps going until stopped. The log waits for a screen to stand still before recording it, because the sidecar emits a screen per keystroke and a page per character is not a log anybody can read; identical screens are dropped for the same reason. The tab title carries `(log)` while it runs, since the operator information area is repainted by every update and cannot hold a state that outlasts one. Passwords need no special handling: non-display fields are blanked in the sidecar, before a screen ever reaches this side.

## 9-10 September — several sessions to one host

Tags: `v0.12.0`

Next on the gap list, and the smallest of the lot once it was looked at: the Python side had always keyed its worker threads and Tnz objects by whatever session id it was sent, so it could run any number of them side by side. The single session per host was entirely a habit of the extension — `SessionPanel.sessionId` was set to the profile's id, and the map of open tabs was keyed the same way. Giving a tab an id of its own was most of the change.

The rest was deciding what the sidebar says. One row stands for a profile, so its icon now reports the liveliest of its tabs and its description carries a count once there is more than one; **Connect** still goes to the first tab, and **New Session** is what opens another, so nobody's habits change. Tabs after the first are numbered in the title, `DB2B (#2)`, taking the lowest number the host is not already using rather than a running total, so closing and reopening does not walk the numbering up. Capture and log file names carry the same number, because two tabs on one host can start logging within the same second and the timestamp alone would have them share a file.

Testing found the sidebar wanting within minutes, and in both directions: Disconnect on the host row dropped both sessions at once, and Connect afterwards revived only one, leaving the other tab open with nothing behind it and no way to bring it back. Both came of a row that stands for a profile being the only handle on tabs that are not the profile. The host row now works on the host and says so — Connect revives every idle tab rather than the first, Disconnect asks which one, or all — and each tab has its own Reconnect and Disconnect, plus a palette command for whichever tab is in front of you.

Those per-tab rows hang off the host, which becomes a branch as soon as it has two. That has a cost worth recording: a tree reserves the chevron column for a whole level as soon as one row in it can expand, so every host in the list shifts sideways the moment any one of them gains a second tab, and no extension can opt out of it — the CSS that would suppress it is reserved for the editor's own file trees. Moving the tabs into a Sessions view of their own below Hosts avoids the shift entirely and was tried, but a second list reads worse than a branch, so the shift stays. The tree keeps no copy of session state either way; it reads it from the live panels, so a row and its tab cannot disagree.

Two things fall out of the profile being shared rather than copied. Editing it repaints every tab on it, which is free and right. A pinned LU is not: VTAM will only have it in session once, so a second tab on a profile with an LU name is refused by the host. Saying so before connecting is cheaper than letting the user read a VTAM message, so New Session warns and then tries anyway, in case the LU has since been freed.

## What was left on purpose

- DUP / Field Mark keys.
- Host-initiated IND$FILE.
- Per-host macros.
- A chord-capture or editable keymap UI (the setting and Show Keyboard Map were enough).
- Title-bar transfer icons, if they still fail to appear; the palette commands are the supported path.
- Cut in the right-click menu; a terminal cannot cut host data.
- A font weight in the host profile. Light faces of families that Windows does not split into their own family are therefore unreachable by name.
- Fonts the webview's Chromium will not resolve, such as the CaskaydiaCove NF families here. They are named differently to what it will match, and guessing the other spelling was judged worse than leaving them out.
- Deriving the keymap platform from the UI rather than the extension host; see the Remote-SSH note above.

## Where it stands

Current packaged version at the end of this record: **0.12.0**.

`origin` is the BMC GHE repository and the source of truth; the public GitHub repository is a mirror. The same source builds both flavours, the display name coming from a branding overlay at package time.

Reference documentation lives beside this file: [README](README.md), [keymap](docs/KEYMAP.md), [macros](docs/MACROS.md), [file transfer](docs/TRANSFER.md) and [settings](docs/SETTINGS.md).
